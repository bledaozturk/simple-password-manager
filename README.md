# Simple Password Manager

A tiny Python script that lets you type in passwords for different services.

## How It Works

- Run the script
- Enter the name of a service
- Enter its password
- Hit Enter on an empty line to stop
- It’ll show everything you typed in

⚠️ This script stores passwords in plain text in memory and displays them on the screen. Do **not** use it for real or sensitive information.
